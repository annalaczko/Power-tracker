# Power tracker 
 Home-made app for tracking power inflow and outflow

## Requirements 
 Download Python from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## After downloading the repository
After installing Python, you have to run one script to install the required libraries.
In root, choose the folder of the Operating System (OS) you use and run `install-lib`

## Using the code
Run the power-tracker.py file. A black window will pop up, then your browser will open the generated HTML file.

## HTML not opening, strange text appearing on the black page
Try to run `update-lib` in your OS' library, then try again. If it doesn't solve the problem, contact me.
